# Credit Card Fraud Detection
<hr>

Credit Card fraud detection is a machine learning project in which we build a machine learning model that will provide the best results in revealing and preventing fraudulent transactions.
<br>
The main concept used in this project is the concept of Logistic Regression.
<br>
Logistic regression is a statistical analysis method to predict a binary outcome, such as yes or no, based on prior observations of a data set. A logistic regression model predicts a dependent data variable by analyzing the relationship between one or more existing independent variables.<br>
Here I have considered 0 or No to be a normal transaction and 1 or Yes to be a Fraudulent transaction.<br>
The main libraries that are used in the project are:
<ol> 1. Numpy
<ol>2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. MatPlotLib
5. Sklearn
</ol>
